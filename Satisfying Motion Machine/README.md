# Satisfying-Motion-OpenGL-Scene-COSC363
Within this repo is the first assignment for the OpenGL computer graphics and computer science course COSC363 at the University of Canterbury. This shows a scene with several pendulums oscilationing through a rotating yoyo.

**To Run:**
On a linux machine run the following commands in the terminal containing this repo:
* `cmake.`
* `make`
* `./Source.out`

**Controls:**
* `←` | Rotates the angle of the camera by one degree in the negative direction. The camera 
position is then changed to be pointing directly at the centre of the scene. 
* `→` | Rotates the angle of the camera by one degree in the positive direction. The camera 
position is then changed to be pointing directly at the centre of the scene.
* `↑` | Increases the distance from the centre of the scene by one unit (metre). 
* `↓` | Decreases the distance from the centre of the scene by one unit (metre). 
* `S` | Toggles the light coming from the sun on and off.
